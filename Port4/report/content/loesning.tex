\section{Introduction}
\emph{We are given an array that contains N numbers and would like to determine if there are two numbers whose sum equals a given number K.\\
For example we may be given the sequence 4,1,5,2,6,3 and are asked to find a pair of numbers with a sum of 10. In this example 4 and 6 is a valid result.\\
To solve the portfolio do the following:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Implement an O(\(N^{2}\)) algorithm for solving the problem.}
\item \emph{Implement an O(N Log(N)) algorithm for solving the problem. (Hint: Consider sorting the list.)}
\item \emph{Perform experiments with different values of N (generate the associated random lists yourselves)
and plot the time as function of N, to verify the time complexity.}
\end{itemize}
\emph{You may use a build in sorting algorithm and assume that it sorts in N Log(N).}

\section{Use of algorithms}
\subsection{O(\(N^{2}\))}
\todo[inline]{Description af the algorithm}
To solve the problem in O(\(N^{2}\)), the group has implemented two for-loops. Each for-loop will iterate through all elements in the list there by O(\(N^{2}\)). For each element, it will then iterate through all elements again to determine if the sum of two elements will yield the result.
\begin{lstlisting}
for element1 in list:
    for element2 in list:
         if element1 + elemt2 = sum:
            return true
\end{lstlisting}
If the sum is found, the function will return true.
The maxvalue has been set to two times the max value in the list plus one to make sure its worstcase has been tested.
The tests have been done by making the sum equal to a higher value than the elements in the list can be.
To optimize the implementation, the inner for-loop should only run from the outer-loops' position and forward.
\begin{lstlisting}
  for(int i = 0; i < vector.size(); ++i){
  	for(int j = i+1; j < vector.size); ++j){
  		....
  	}
  }
\end{lstlisting}

This will give a time complexity of O(N(N-k)) where k is the time the inner for-loop runs.
