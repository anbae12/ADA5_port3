\section{Introduction}
\emph{We are given an array that contains N numbers and would like to determine if there are two numbers whose sum equals a given number K.\\For example we may be given the sequence 4,1,5,2,6,3 and are asked to find a pair of numbers with a sum of 10. In this example 4 and 6 is a valid result.\\
To solve the portfolio do the following:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Implement an O(\(N^{2}\)) algorithm for solving the problem.}
\item \emph{Implement an O(N Log(N)) algorithm for solving the problem. (Hint: Consider sorting the list.)}
\item \emph{Perform experiments with different values of N (generate the associated random lists yourselves)and plot the time as function of N, to verify the time complexity.}
\end{itemize}\emph{You may use a build in sorting algorithm and assume that it sorts in N Log(N).}
