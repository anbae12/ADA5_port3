\section{Implementation choice}
Each vertex is represented by a class called Vertex. This includes a string with the name of the vertex, a priority queue  including all of it's edges.  The reason why it has been choosen to use a priorityqueue, instead of an ordinary vector  is to avoid using a sorting algorithm to sort the vector.
